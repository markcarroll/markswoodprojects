I wanted to build a potting bench for my wife, so I did a ton of research looking for the right plan to build. I found a few good plans but decided to settle on the one on the Family Handyman web site [here](http://www.familyhandyman.com/garden/how-to-build-a-cedar-potting-bench/view-all). They have an easy to follow plan that is [freely available](http://hostedmedia.reimanpub.com/TFH/Attachments/FH00JAU_CEDARC_02.pdf).
