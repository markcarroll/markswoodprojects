I was unable to post any pictures of this project since I was building these as a Christmas gift to my wife. However they are finished now and she loves them, so now I can post&#8230;

I wanted to make something that challenged me, and since I hate projects involving curves, and for some reason dread using my bandsaw, I decided to make these bandsaw vases.

They turned out better than I expected and gave me some good learning experiences along the way. I also think doing this project broke some of my fears and misgivings about my bandsaw and have made me a lot more confident about using it now.

Thanks to Steve at the <a href="http://www.thecarmichaelworkshop.com" target="_blank">The Carmichael Workshop</a> for the inspiration.
