This weekend I put together this end table to go in our bathroom. I needed something narrow but still useful. It is 2 feet high and measures 11&#8243; by 18&#8243;. The wood cost around $10 from Home Depot and it only took a few hours to build.

Materials needed:  
1 – 2 x 2 @ 8 feet long  
1 – 1 x 6 @ 6 feet long  
1 – 1 x 2 @ 4 feet long  
1-1/4&#8243; pocket hole screws  
wood glue

Cut the pieces to size as follows:

2 – 1&#215;6 @ 18-1/2&#8243;  
2 – 1&#215;6 @ 16&#8243;  
4 – 2&#215;2 @ 23-1/4&#8243;  
2 – 1&#215;2 @ 14&#8243;  
2 – 1&#215;2 @ 7&#8243;

#### Step 1:

After cutting the pieces to size run the edges of the four 1&#215;6 pieces through a jointer if you have one to square up the edges. you will be gluing each pair together to make the top and the shelf, so make sure that you pick which sides you want facing up.  The ideal choice will be to have the grain alternating between the two pieces (one face up and one face down) to minimize expansion and contraction of the top.

&nbsp;

Once you have chosen which pieces you want where, put some glue along one edge of each board and clamp them together.  If you have a biscuit joiner you can put biscuits between them to keep them level.  I did this for the top but not for the shelf, and honestly given the small size of the pieces, I don&#8217;t think they were necessary.
