I made this walnut and cherry hope chest a few years back. &nbsp; I used [this plan](http://www.woodmagazine.com/woodworking-plans/furniture/bedroom/heirloom-chest/) from Wood Magazine.

Ironically, at the time, I was only just getting interested in woodworking and had just signed up for that magazine, when I got an email telling me I had won their monthly sweepstake and they were going to send me all the wood necessary to build that project. Then a couple of weeks later a shipment of walnut and cherry arrived as promised.

This was the first time that I used decent hardwood and I have to say, I really loved how the walnut cut on the table saw. So smooth.

I assembled it according to the plans and it came out looking great before I even finished it.

To finish it I used a few coats of wipe on poly.

Here is the finished result:<figure id="attachment_118" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

I think it came out pretty well and my wife absolutely loves it.

P.S. Sorry for the low quality pictures. &nbsp;As my wife pointed out, you can tell it was a while back that I made it due to the picture quality. Yes this was before iPhones!
