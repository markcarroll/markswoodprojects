My wife loves gardening and I love making her things, so this garden tote was a great quick project that gave me something to build and leave her with something she could use when gardening. It was made out of a couple of cedar fence pickets that I bought from [Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Alta-Forest-Products-5-8-in-x-3-1-2-in-x-6-ft-Western-Red-Cedar-Flat-Top-Fence-Picket-63006/205757683) for $1.54 each.

It was very simple to make and really only had three different sized pieces (plus the handle).

#### Materials needed for the Garden Tote:

- 2 [Cedar fence pickets](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Alta-Forest-Products-5-8-in-x-3-1-2-in-x-6-ft-Western-Red-Cedar-Flat-Top-Fence-Picket-63006/205757683) – 6' long and 4" wide
- 1 [wooden dowel 7/8″ diameter](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-6414U-7-8-in-x-7-8-in-x-48-in-Hardwood-Round-Dowel-10001807/203334067), or whatever you feel comfortable holding
- 1¼" exterior grade screws – I like the [GRK brand](https://amzn.to/3kZOWlK) best as the star head ensures the driver does not slip and strip the head

#### Cut List:

- 7  pieces 12½" long
- 2 pieces 16½" long for the long sides
- 2 pieces 13" long for the handles
- 1 wooden dowel to fit (mine was 17¾")

#### Steps:

1. Cut all the pieces to length as described in the cut list. I rounded off one end of each of the two handle supports for aesthetics [![-](/assets/images/garden-tote/Garden-Tote-step-2.jpg)](/assets/images/garden-tote/Garden-Tote-step-2.jpg)
2. Screw the ends onto the long sides making sure you get them square [![-](/assets/images/garden-tote/Garden-Tote-step-3.jpg)](/assets/images/garden-tote/Garden-Tote-step-3.jpg)
3. Screw one bottom board onto either end of the box [![-](/assets/images/garden-tote/Garden-Tote-step-4.jpg)](/assets/images/garden-tote/Garden-Tote-step-4.jpg)
4. Spread the three remaining bottom pieces out evenly and screw in [![-](/assets/images/garden-tote/Garden-Tote-step-5.jpg)](/assets/images/garden-tote/Garden-Tote-step-5.jpg)
5. Attach the two 13&#8243; tall handle side pieces and finally [![-](/assets/images/garden-tote/Garden-Tote2.jpg)](/assets/images/garden-tote/Garden-Tote2.jpg)
6. Measure the gap between the two handle sides and cut the dowel to fit. Then screw through the handle supports into the dowel
