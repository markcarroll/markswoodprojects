This is a Craftsman style coffee table I built a few years back. It has survived very well and still the center of our living room. It is made from poplar with a cherry stain applied.

I built it from a plan I found in this issue of [WoodSmith magazine](https://amzn.to/1hJ9Kfy)

It was relatively straightforward to build although the small spindles were a pain to cut and even more so to finish, but I am still very happy with the end result.
