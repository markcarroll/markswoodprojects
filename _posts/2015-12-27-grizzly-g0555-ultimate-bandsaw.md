This is my [Grizzly G0555 Ultimate Bandsaw](https://amzn.to/1ShpoNl). I was scared of using it for the longest time.  Turns out I just needed to learn how to setup and adjust it properly. See my [Bandsaw Vase](/projects/bandsaw-vases/) post for my first real project with it.

As bandsaws go it comes pretty well equipped with ball bearing blade guides, easy tensioning lever and a good sized 14&#8243; clearance for manipulating pieces around the blade.

Mine was not very well adjusted, I think as a casualty to having been moved (houses) a couple of times before I really got to grips with it, so when I tried to use it on the odd occasion it didn&#8217;t perform well and I gave up with it and put it back in the corner.

For the [Bandsaw Vase](/projects/bandsaw-vases/) project though, I had no choice so I had to force myself to get past my misgivings and work it out.  I sat and watched a bunch of people using bandsaws on youtube and realized that it couldn&#8217;t be that hard and something had to be wrong.  There was no recourse but to read the dreaded manual&#8230;  Anyway, needless to say, after going through all the calibration process I got it to a point where it seemed to be working much better than it had been before and I made the vases without too much trouble (other than a distinct lack of technique).  I will continue to push myself to build more projects with this tool to build up my skill.
